##\#whoami


In IT since 2006, in Java since 2014

Practice TDD since then

In Vattenfall since 2016

TODO: solution architect?

Currently developer and solution architect in eMobility

From time to time speaker at community events and conferences
---

##Introduction round

Name

Occupation

Experience

TDD & OOP familiarity

Expectations

---
##Agenda

1. TDD
    - basics
    - test doubles
    - test approaches
    - integration and unit tests
    - tests as design tool

2. OOP
    - basics
    - SOLID
    - Cohesion and coupling

3. Vending machine *kata*
---
##TDD

What are your first thoughts?

Inverted order?

---
##Feedback loops

How fast do you want to know that software is working?

How fast is *fast*?

Automatic tests for the rescue, but they must be *fast*

Long feedback loops kills focus

---
##Feedback loops

TODO: image
---
##Testing

What good test should do?

What features good test has?
---
##Test Driven Development

Red -> Green -> Refactor

TODO: image
---
##Test Driven Development

TODO: uncle bob's 3 laws
---
##Test Driven Development

---
##Test structure

Given

When

Then
---
##Test Driven Development - exercise


---
##Testing approaches

Black box

White box
---
##Blackbox testing

Focused on behaviour

Ignores implementation details
---
##Whitebox testing

Assumes knowledge of implementation details
---
##Testing approaches pros/cons

Black box

White box


---
##Types of tests
Unit

Integration

---
##Unit tests

Basic introduction

---
##Unit tests

What is a unit?

A class?

A method?

Testing private methods?
TODO: Kent Beck's
---
##Unit tests

Scope of test - it dependes

TODO: sample, and exercise for unit test
---
##Integration tests

I/O integration

What I/O is?
---
##Test doubles

Way of testing interactions with collaborators
---
##Test pyramid

TODO: image

---
##Test doubles

Fake

Mocks

Stubs

---
## Mocking

Problems

TODO: code samples, and example
---

##Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Encapsulatiion

Polymorphism

Inheritance

---
##OOP - encapsulation/information hiding

Hidden implementation details

Scalable at multiple levels

Setters/getters

TODO: Demeter law
TODO: code sample

---


##OOP - encapsulation at scale

Modules

Microservices
---

##OOP - inheritance

Doesn't work

Why? Let's see :)

TODO: broken encapsulation, high coupling, code sample

---
##OOP - polymorphism

Interface and implementation(naming)

Strategy/state design pattern

Naming conventions?

---
##OOP in practice

What does Object Oriented language mean?

Is Java an OO language?

If no, what should be changed?

Is '''class''' keyword enough to be OO?

---
##OOP in practice - heuristics

SOLID

Cohesion - coupling


---
##SOLID

SRP

OCP

LSP

ISP

DIP

---

##SRP

Single Responsibility Principle

"Do one thing"

"One reason to change"

Sounds quite academic

Do event authors understant it?

---
##OCP

Open Closed Principle

"Open for extensions, closed for modification"

What design patterns styles support it?

DI

IOC

Interfaces

Events

Higher order functions

---
##LSP

Substitution of interfaces' implementation must be possible

Focus on behaviour

How code must be tested to ensure it?

---
##ISP

Interface segregation principle

API width


---
##DIP

Client should depend on abstraction not implementation

Should everything have interface?
---
##Cohesion and coupling

WTF are they?

---
##Cohesion

TODO: sample
---
##Coupling

TODO: sample
---
##High cohesion low coupling

Probably most important design rule in IT development

OOP

DDD

Modules

Microservices

---
##High cohesion low coupling


TODO: sample
